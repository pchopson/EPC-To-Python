# EPC-To-Python
# A project to convert the Excel based Energy Performance Calculator to Python
# Because the EPC is in Excel its market penetration remains low. Engineers usually cannot accept comparative results from
# an Excel based tool. Let's code the EPC into Python so it can be used on the web or within Dynamo for Revit or Grasshopper
# for Rhino.
