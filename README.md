# EPC-To-Python
 Download the Excel version of the EPC at http://zeroenergygreen.com/downloads/
 A project to convert the Excel based Energy Performance Calculator to Python
 Because the EPC is in Excel its market penetration remains low. Engineers usually cannot accept comparative results from
 an Excel based tool. Let's code the EPC into Python so it can be used on the web or within Dynamo for Revit or Grasshopper
 for Rhino.
