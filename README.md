# EPC-To-Python

Open source.

 A project to convert the Excel based Energy Performance Calculator to Python
 Because the EPC is in Excel its market penetration remains low. Engineers usually cannot accept comparative results from
 an Excel based tool. Let's code the EPC into Python so it can be used on the web or within Dynamo for Revit or Grasshopper
 for Rhino.

KEY FEATURES OF THE EPC

- The EPC (Energy Performance Calculator) is an Excel based energy modeling software.
- Instant results no waiting for calculation results.
- Reduces a building down to “box”
- Developed for 20 years at the Georgia Institute of Technology Building Technology Lab.
- Normative energy calculator defined by ISO 13970 and CEN 15603.
- Monthly and Hourly versions proven superior to dynamic simulation dynamic simulation methods in ASHRAE 90.1, Appendix G.
